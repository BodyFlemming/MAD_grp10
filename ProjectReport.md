## App Vision

The app allows users to collect and view rare Pokémon, which you can boast about and show off to your friends.
Users can catch random Pokémon through the app, store them in their collection, and see where each Pokémon was caught on a map. The app combines fun with technology by integrating Firebase Authentication for secure user accounts, Firestore for storing user and Pokémon data, and PokéAPI for fetching Pokémon information such as names, images, and types.

Each user has a personal profile where they can view account details and manage their collection. The app aims to create a light, gamified experience where users can feel a sense of progression and ownership over their Pokémon while exploring real-world locations through GPS.
